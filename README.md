I am a B.Sc. graduate in Industrial Engineering (GPA 3.8/4.0) from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), where my academic journey led me toward applying artificial intelligence and data science to real-world challenges, with a current focus on healthcare. My current research as a Research Assistant focuses on graph neural networks for medication recommendation and drugâ€“drug interaction prediction using MIMIC-IV, with two manuscripts in preparation.

Through both research and professional experience, I have developed expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data science. Professionally, I designed and implemented relational databases to improve data accessibility, built interactive KPI dashboards for real-time monitoring, and developed clustering-based segmentation and churn prediction models to enhance retention strategies. I also led business analytics projects in sales forecasting and benchmarking, and created demand forecasting models that strengthened inventory planning and supply chain efficiency.

Certified in Applied Data Science by MIT Professional Education, with experience in Python (PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy), SQL/databases, and BI tools. I am passionate about bridging AI, healthcare, and data science to build interpretable systems that enhance decision-making and create meaningful real-world impact.
